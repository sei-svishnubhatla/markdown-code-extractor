This appendix contains guidelines for functions that are defined as part of the Microsoft Windows API \[[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh447209(v=vs.85).aspx)\] and the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler \[[MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/60k1461a.aspx)\]. These rules and recommendations are not part of the core standard because they do not apply in all C language applications. The intent of providing these guidelines is to demonstrate how rules and recommendations for other standards or specific [implementations](BB.-Definitions_87152273.html#BB.Definitions-implementation) may be integrated with the core C recommendations.
