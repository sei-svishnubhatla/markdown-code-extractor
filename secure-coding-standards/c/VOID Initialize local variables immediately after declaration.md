> This guideline has been labeled [void](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu//confluence/label/seccode/void) and designated for future elimination from the C Secure Coding Standard. For an equivalent guideline, see the C++ Secure Coding Practices, recommendation [VOID DCL19-CPP. Initialize automatic local variables on declaration](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/cplusplus/VOID+DCL19-CPP.+Initialize+automatic+local+variables+on+declaration). This guideline has not been erased yet in case it contains information that might still be useful.
