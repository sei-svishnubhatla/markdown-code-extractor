The `assert()` macro is a convenient mechanism for incorporating diagnostic tests in code. (See [MSC11-C. Incorporate diagnostic tests using assertions](MSC11-C_%20Incorporate%20diagnostic%20tests%20using%20assertions).) Expressions used with the standard `assert` macro should not have [side effects](BB.-Definitions_87152273.html#BB.Definitions-sideeffect). Typically, the behavior of the `assert` macro depends on the status of the `NDEBUG` preprocessor symbol. If `NDEBUG` is undefined, the `assert` macro is defined to evaluate its expression argument and abort if the result of the expression is convertible to `false`. If `NDEBUG` is defined, `assert` is defined to be a no-op. Consequently, any side effects resulting from evaluation of the expression in the assertion are lost in non-debugging versions of the code.
Because `assert` is a macro, this rule is a special case of [PRE31-C. Avoid side effects in arguments to unsafe macros](PRE31-C_%20Avoid%20side%20effects%20in%20arguments%20to%20unsafe%20macros).
## Noncompliant Code Example
This noncompliantÂ code example includes an `assert` macro containing an expression (`index++`) that has a side effect:
``` c
#include <assert.h>
void process(size_t index) {
  assert(index++ > 0); /* Side effect */
  /* ... */
}
```
## Compliant Solution
This compliant solution avoids the possibility of side effects in assertions by moving the expression containing the side effect outside of the `assert` macro.
``` c
#include <assert.h>
void process(size_t index) {
  assert(index > 0); /* No side effect */
  ++index;
  /* ... */
}
```
## Risk Assessment
Side effects in assertions can lead to [unexpected](BB.-Definitions_87152273.html#BB.Definitions-unexpectedbehavior) and erroneous behavior.

| Side effects in assertions lead to Heisenbugs - this is a huge problem where it works for the devs but not for QA.

| Does this guideline apply to assertion functions, such as:
extern void my_assert(int);
void f(int i)
{
my_assert(i++);
}

As written, this rule only applies to the standard assert macro.
Because assert is a macro, this rule is a special case of PRE31-C. Never invoke an unsafe macro with arguments containing assignment, increment, decrement, volatile access, or function call.
Because `my_assert()` in your example is a function, there is no problem with this code. There is always a sequence point before a function invocation meaning that the side effects must be completed before the call.
