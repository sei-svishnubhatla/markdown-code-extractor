Do not use a semicolon on the same line as an `if`, `for`, or `while` statement because it typically indicates programmer error and can result in unexpected behavior.
## Noncompliant Code Example
In this noncompliant code example, a semicolon is used on the same line as an `if` statement:
``` c
if (a == b); {
  /* ... */
}
```
## Compliant Solution
It is likely, in this example, that the semicolon was accidentally inserted:
``` c
if (a == b) {
  /* ... */
}
```
## Risk Assessment
Errors of omission can result in unintended program flow.

| This guideline seems way too strict.  For example, I see nothing wrong with the following example:
if ( x ) y++;

Notice this example is nonconforming because a semicolon appears on the same line as the if.

I think this guideline should be eliminated and the example integrated with [MSC12-C. Detect and remove code that has no effect](/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=c&title=MSC12-C.+Detect+and+remove+code+that+has+no+effect)

I agree that this is draconian. I suspect the intent is to prevent problems such as:
``` java
char* strchr(const char *str, int c) {
  for (; *str; ++str);   /* <<< forgot to remove semicolon */
    if ((unsigned char)*str == c)
      return str;
  return NULL;
}
```
that are sometimes introduced by copying and pasting, for instance from code such as:
``` java
size_t strlen(const char *str) {
  const char *s = str;
  for (; *str; ++str);
  return (size_t)(str - s);
}
```
(Note the `strchr()` implementation above is buggy in another way that's unrelated to the semicolon.)

There is no; risk assesment for this recommendation
