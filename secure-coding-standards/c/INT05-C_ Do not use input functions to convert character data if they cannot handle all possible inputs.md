Do not use functions that input characters and convert them to integers if the functions cannot handle all possible inputs. For example, formatted input functions such as `scanf()`, `fscanf()`, `vscanf()`, and `vfscanf()` can be used to read string data from `stdin` or (in the cases of `fscanf()` and `vfscanf()`) other input streams. These functions work fine for valid integer values but lack robust error handling for invalid values.
Alternatively, input character data as a null-terminated byte string and convert to an integer value using `strtol()` or a related function. (See [ERR34-C. Detect errors when converting a string to a number](ERR34-C_%20Detect%20errors%20when%20converting%20a%20string%20to%20a%20number).)
## Noncompliant Code Example
This noncompliant code example uses the `scanf()` function to read a string from `stdin` and convert it to a `long`. The `scanf()` and `fscanf()` functions have [undefined behavior](BB.-Definitions_87152273.html#BB.Definitions-undefinedbehavior) if the value of the result of this operation cannot be represented as an integer.
``` c
long num_long;
if (scanf("%ld", &num_long) != 1) {
  /* Handle error */
}
```
In general, do not use `scanf()` to parse integers or floating-point numbers from input strings because the input could contain numbers not representable by the argument type.
## Compliant Solution (Linux)
This compliant example uses the Linux `scanf()` implementation's built-in error handling to validate input. On Linux platforms, `scanf()` sets `errno` to `ERANGE` if the result of integer conversion cannot be represented within the size specified by the format string \[[Linux 2008](AA.-Bibliography_87152170.html#AA.Bibliography-Linux08)\]. Note that this solution is platform dependent, so it should be used only where portability is not a concern.
``` c
long num_long;
errno = 0;
if (scanf("%ld", &num_long) != 1) {
  /* Handle error */
}
else if (ERANGE == errno) {
  if (puts("number out of range\n") == EOF) {
      /* Handle error */
  }
}
```
## Compliant Solution
This compliant example uses `fgets()` to input a string and `strtol()` to convert the string to an integer. Error checking is provided to make sure the value is a valid integer in the range of `long`.
``` c
char buff[25];
char *end_ptr;
long num_long;
if (fgets(buff, sizeof(buff), stdin) == NULL) {
  if (puts("EOF or read error\n") == EOF) {
    /* Handle error */
  }
} else {
  errno = 0;
  num_long = strtol(buff, &end_ptr, 10);
  if (ERANGE == errno) {
    if (puts("number out of range\n") == EOF) {
      /* Handle error */
    }
  }
  else if (end_ptr == buff) {
    if (puts("not valid numeric input\n") == EOF) {
      /* Handle error */
    }
  }
  else if ('\n' != *end_ptr && '\0' != *end_ptr) {
    if (puts("extra characters on input line\n") == EOF) {
      /* Handle error */
    }
  }
}
```
Note that this solution treats any trailing characters, including whitespace characters, as an error condition.

## Comments:

| ----|
| This rule needs to make clearer exactly what is verbotem in the scanf() family. My interpretation is that one must not pass as input parameter a pointer to any integer smaller than intmax_t (signed or unsigned), because a smaller integer might not be able to hold the object read in, resulting in undefined behavior.
On second thought, both intmax_t and uintmax_t are also insufficient, because uintmax_t can't hold -1 and intmax_t can't hold UINT_MAX. So maybe this vul is unavoidable and we should forbid using scanf() on all ints, like the CCE illustrates.
So can scanf() be done securely on ints?
