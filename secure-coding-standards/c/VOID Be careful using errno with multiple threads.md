| I'm having a hard time understanding this recommendation, which is sort of odd, since I wrote it initially.  Is it possible to provide a Non-Compliant Code Example and a Compliant Solution?  What are the right and wrong things to do here?

| I'm confused too.; The only thing I can think of is to make sure any multithreaded code that uses errno is not run on an old system from before the updated POSIX standard.

| To add more confusion to this, looks like Open Group redefined this as allowing macros, and that most implementations do just that.
Do we really want to recommend for people not use errno in multithreading?; Everything I have found online says that is OK since the thread libraries "take care of it"

| On some systems you onlyget the thread-safe errno definition if you compile the code in a certain way. If you mix object files (or libraries) compiled both ways, and you call functions that were compiled the non-thread-safe way from multiple threads, then those functions will all try to use the same (global) errno instead of each using the thread-specific errno for the thread that called it.
So I think the issue here is not about how you write the code, but how you compile it.;

| I recommend removing this item.; If the system supports POSIX threads, errno will be safe (as long as you include <errno.h> and don't try to fake it with 'extern int errno;').Â  If the system doesn't support POSIX threads, you've got worse problems than 'your non-POSIX threads might access a non-thread-safe errno'.
